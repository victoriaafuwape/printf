# printf Project
## Project Overview

Welcome to the `printf` project! This repository is dedicated to the development of your own `printf` function in C. This project consists of 15 tasks, each building upon the previous one, culminating in a fully functional `printf` implementation.

## Project Structure
To maintain an organized and structured project, we've outlined the following guidelines:

### Compilation
All code files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the following flags:

bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c

### Task Progression
Each task will have its own file with the necessary files for that task. As we progress through the project, we will add new files and directories for each subsequent task.

### Project Tasks
Here is an overview of the 15 tasks that make up this project:

1. *Task 0*: Write a function that produces output according to a format.
2. *Task 1*: Handle the following conversion specifiers.
3. *Task 2*: Handle the following custom conversion specifiers.
4. *Task 3*: Handle the following conversion specifiers.
5. *Task 4*: Use a local buffer of 1024 chars to minimize calls to `write`.
6. *Task 5*: Handle the following custom conversion specifier.
7. *Task 6*: Handle the `p` conversion specifier.
8. *Task 7*: Handle the following flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers.
9. *Task 8*: Handle the following length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers.
10. *Task 9*: Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
11. *Task 10*: Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
12. *Task 11*: Handle the `0` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
13. *Task 12*: Handle the `-` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
14. *Task 13*: Handle another custom conversion specifier.
15. *Task 14*: Ensure that all the above options work well together.

### Project Progression

To follow along with the project's progress, you can check out the relevant files for each task. We'll be working through each task sequentially, and each task's completion will be clearly indicated.

### Getting Started

If you want to run and test the functions for each task, compile the appropriate file along with the `main.c` in the root directory.


### Contact

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the authors via Twitter or open an issue in this repository. We're excited to collaborate and build this `printf` implementation together!

Happy coding! 😊
